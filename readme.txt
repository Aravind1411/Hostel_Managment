The hostel management system is developed to create and maintain the
records of students who are presently occupying the rooms,those who are
put on hold in the waiting list,to display the students who are occupying the
rooms,those who are present in the waiting list,etc.It basically maintains
the room allotment for three types of rooms (i.e single,shared,international)
in which each type has three rooms available for occupancy and in turn 2
people can share one room in the shared category.All these operations are
accessible to the admins whose access is being controlled by passwords.
